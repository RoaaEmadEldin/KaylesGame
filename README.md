# KaylesGame

This game begins with an arbitrary number of tokens in a single row. The first player enters the number of tokens (n) they want to play with, that is divisible by 10. The tokens are represented as numbers from (1) to (n).

Two players alternate turns. During a turn a player may remove either one or two adjacent tokens. The player who removes the last token wins.
